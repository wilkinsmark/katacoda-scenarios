Creating an S3 BucketA simple line of code will allow us to create an S3 bucket in a specific AWS region. it's important to understand that an S3 bucket location is “regional”. This means that the bucket that is created, and the contents of the bucket will be located in the selected AWS region. The other important piece of information to keep in mind is that the name of the S3 bucket is defined as “global”. What's does the term global mean? Well, every S3 bucket name must be unique across the entire AWS cloud. the reason for this requirement is that S3 bucket names are also DNS names. Amazon has a DNS service called Route 53; all S3 bucket names are stored in Route 53 as a DNS record, and DNS records require a unique name. Now you know why naming a bucket is simple and complicated at the same time!One more interesting tidbit… OK two tidbits…..The aws at the start of the command is alerting AWS that a task request is going to be sent via the CLIThe s3api informs AWS that the task is an S3 task executing S3 API’sThe rest of the command tells AWS to create a bucket called my-bucket in the US-West-2 region.aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucket --region us-west-2 {{execute}}
