Use the Amazon S3 ConsoleLet’s use the AWS Management Console to find the S3 Service.At the top left, click the orange keypad to the left of ServicesIn the middle of the screen click All ServicesScroll down slowly, on the left, under Storage is S3Click S3 to open the Amazon S3 consoleNote in the top right-hand corner it says “Global”. remember we talked about the names of each S3 bucket and how each name had to be global; that is unique. The bucket that we created <bucket-name> is listed.Note the AWS region where your bucket is located.Note the defined access controls that have been applied to your bucket: the defined access role is that a newly created bucket and its objects are not public. only the creator of the S3 bucket has full access to the bucket and its contents.We can also view the creation date. We could use the CLI to gather this information, and perhaps under certain circumstances you might want to create a report of all buckets in your account using the CLI. hopefully you'll agree with me that using the Amazon S3 console Makes it easy to review details of an S3 bucket.
